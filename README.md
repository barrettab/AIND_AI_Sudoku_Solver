# AIND_AI_Sudoku_Solver

Quickstart Guide


Follow the instructions in the classroom lesson to install and configure the aind Anaconda environment which includes several important packages that are used for the project. OS X or Unix/Linux users can activate the aind environment by running the following (Windows users simply run activate aind):

$ source activate aind

You can run a small set of test cases using the local test suite.

(aind)$ python -m unittest -v

Copy your code from the classroom for the search and basic strategies, then add the diagonal units at the top of the solutions.py file and complete the naked_twins() function. Pseudocode for the naked_twins() function is available here.

Run the test suite again to check your progress. Once you pass all the test cases in the local test suite, you can submit the project to run more comprehensive tests with the remote test suite:

(aind)$ udacity submit

You can run the code with visualization (see the last section of the readme for more information)

(aind)$ python solution.py

Notes
You will not receive credit for the project until you submit the zip file created by udacity submit in your classroom.

You must submit exactly the zip file created by the CLI in step 3 to the classroom; if you make any changes to the file, you'll receive an error message when you attempt to submit in the classroom.
